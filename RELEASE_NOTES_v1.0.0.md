# Open LPR v1.0.0 Release Notes

We're excited to announce the first major release of Open LPR - a powerful, open-source License Plate Recognition system powered by AI!

## 🎉 What is Open LPR?

Open LPR is a Django-based web application that uses the Qwen3-VL AI model to detect and recognize license plates in images with advanced OCR capabilities. The system provides both a user-friendly web interface and a comprehensive REST API for integration into other applications.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🤖 **AI-Powered Detection**: Uses qwen3-vl-4b-instruct vision-language model for accurate license plate recognition
- 🔍 **Advanced OCR Integration**: Extracts text from detected license plates with confidence scores
- 🎯 **Bounding Box Visualization**: Draws colored boxes around detected plates and OCR text
- 📤 **Drag & Drop Upload**: Modern, user-friendly file upload interface
- 💾 **Permanent Storage**: All uploaded and processed images are saved permanently
- 🔄 **Side-by-Side Comparison**: View original and processed images together
- 🔎 **Search & Filter**: Browse and search through processing history
- 📱 **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- 🐳 **Docker Support**: Easy deployment with Docker and Docker Compose
- 🔌 **REST API**: Full API for programmatic access

## 🚀 Deployment Options

This release provides multiple deployment options:

1. **Standard Docker Deployment**: Traditional deployment with cloud-based AI services
2. **LlamaCpp CPU Deployment**: Local inference using CPU resources
3. **LlamaCpp GPU Deployment**: Local inference with AMD GPU acceleration using Vulkan

## 🔄 Migration Notes

This is the initial release, so there are no migration requirements. Future releases will include migration guides as needed.

## 🐛 Known Issues

- Large images (>10MB) may require increased memory allocation
- GPU acceleration is currently limited to AMD GPUs with Vulkan support
- Concurrent processing is limited by Django's development server (use Gunicorn in production)

## 🛣️ Roadmap

Future releases will include:

- Support for additional GPU types (NVIDIA CUDA)
- Batch processing capabilities
- Real-time video stream processing
- Additional language support for license plates
- Performance optimizations
- Mobile application
